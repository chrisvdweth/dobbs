# DOBBS - DERI Online Browsing Behavior Study

### In a nutshell
The idea behind DOBBS is to get a deeper understanding how users browse the Web (e.g., how much time they spent on the Web, how long they stay on a website, how often they visit a website, how they use their browser, etc.). To contribute, DOBBS provides a Firefox browser add-on that keeps track of usersâ€™ browsing behavior. DOBBS addresses privacy concerns in a straightforward fashion: no personal data are collected, and all sensitive data (i.e. URLs of visited web pages) are encrypted before being sent to the server.
